# My Course Progress Documentation

This repository serves as a personal documentation space for tracking my progress through various programming courses and learning resources. It's a place where I record my journey, challenges faced, solutions found, and insights gained. The aim is not just to document my own learning path but also to share valuable lessons and resources with anyone interested in similar topics.

## Contents

The repository is structured around the courses and learning resources I'm currently engaged with or have completed. Each course or topic has its own dedicated folder within the repository, containing:

- **Notes**: Summaries of key concepts, theories, and practical applications.
- **Code Snippets**: Relevant pieces of code that illustrate important concepts or solutions.
- **Challenges & Solutions**: Descriptions of difficulties encountered during the course and how they were overcome.
- **Resources**: Links to external articles, videos, forums, and other resources that contributed to my learning. // I will add thoses later.

## How to Use This Repository

While this repository is primarily intended for personal use, it's also meant to be a resource for others. Here's how you can utilize it:
